Minecraft mod that changes movement mechanics. Has very little code left over from Squake, and I'm pretty radically redesigning some of the core systems I made, so I started again from a clean slate; this version will no longer be maintained. New repository is [here](https://github.com/floral-qua-floral/marioQuaMario).
